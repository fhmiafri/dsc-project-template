# MOVIE STUDIO ANALYSIS

**Authors**: Fahmi Afri


## Overview

Microsoft’s new movie studio is exploring a new adventure in films industry . Prior to
embarking into this new business venture, Microsoft is keen to be informed of the
availability of market presence or the best genre for their first movie .


## Business Problem

Microsoft's new movie studio is in the mood for a new fun to create their first ever movie . We collected several datasets from IMDB and BOM to be analysed to : Highest Rated Film Genres, Movie Genre to Movie Gross, Recommended Runtime and Highest Number Of Votes. With this, Microsoft can start narrow it down to what movie to create and focus more on the ideas of their masterpiece .



## Data

In the process of data gathering, reference is made to IMDB and BOM amongst
other available resources.
As per google search, IMDB is one of the best movie rating sites and has several
dynamic Top Lists that we can use to find new movies and TV shows to watch whilst
Box office Mojo(BOM) is measured in terms of the number of tickets sold or the
amount of money raised by ticket sales (revenue). Both projection and analysis of
these earnings/revenue is the measuring stick to determine the interest captured
from the market, in this case the fans or moviegoers.

## Conclusions

● Documentary claims its first score. Being the most rated genre, you can never put your foot wrong in
this.

● Action, Adventure, Sci-fi collected the most domestic gross with the highest number of votes.

● Average running time for each movie is at 86-min. 

However, based on the graph displayed, most movies’ running time is between 90-110 mins .
To sum up, although Documentary reigns the most preferred option, I personally recommend Action,
Adventure and Sci-fi movie genre (superhero, comic characters) based upon the significant votes received
from the market.
